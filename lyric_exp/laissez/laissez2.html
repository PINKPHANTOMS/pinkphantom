  This passage arose out of a conversation I had with a professor at my highschool. I expressed my dissapproval of the culture that was being created at the school. The school held a certain ceremony that placed some students above others; all based on grades. Grades have a blatant connection to the capitalist-zombification of bodies. For example, to say one is a "grade A" student falls in line with the same meaning structure as meat rating; this is a "grade A" a piece of meat. After making a little too much noise about the issue, a professor pulled me aside to speak to me about a better method of addressing the issue. <i>"Go for their pockets"</i>, she said. This was the impetus for <i>Act I: The Gaslight Corporotocracy.</i>

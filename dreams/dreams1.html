  Think about zeno's paradox. To go some amount of distance, you need to go half that distance; and to go half that distance, you need to go half of that distance; and, so on. The idea here is to make you feel like,'how the hell do we even move at all?'. here, I propose, we don't! We don't move through space, maybe through time, but it kinda seems like it's all in our heads... So if distance is just a figment of imagination - how does this play into our sense of separation from ourselves when we develop,'or move from one world of thought to another.'
